{% endhint %}

You can now install Rocket.Chat on DigitalOcean using a 1-Click install from the DigitalOcean Marketplace.

[![do-btn-blue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51996/58146107-50512580-7c1a-11e9-8ec9-e032ba387c2a.png)](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/rocket-chat?action=deploy\&refcode=1940fe28bd31)

After you create your 1-Click install using the Rocket.Chat app in DigitalOcean Marketplace, you'll likely want a registered domain name to access Rocket.Chat.

We recommend setting up an A record from your domain to your servers IP address. Ex: chat.mycompany.com

Rocket.Chat will not work with HTTPS out of the box because certificates are unique for each installation, but with this setup HTTPS will be available using Let's Encrypt certificates.

After the Rocket.Chat One-Click is finished and your domain is setup. You will need to login to your droplet to finish setup.

```
ssh root@your_droplet_ip
```

Once you are connected you should see something like:
