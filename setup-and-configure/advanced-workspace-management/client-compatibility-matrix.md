## Mobile

Our mobile applications have a maximum of 3 major server versions that is supported on each release. All the past releases are not officially supported and may cause problems. It is because our APIs are evolving a lot on each release, and sometimes it is hard to maintain compatibility with older versions when they don’t have support for specific features.

| App Version | Supported releases |
| :---------: | :----------------: |
|    4.0.0+   |        0.70+       |
