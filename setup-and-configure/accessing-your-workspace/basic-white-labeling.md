# Basic White-labeling

Leverage the white-labeling capabilities of Rocket.Chat to give your workspace the look and feel that suits your organization's brand.

To achieve this, you are required to be the workspace administrator having the [admin](../../setup-and-administer-rocket.chat/roles-in-rocket.chat) role.

The UI changes can be managed in the [layout.md](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/layout.md "mention") \*\*\*\* settings of your workspace.
