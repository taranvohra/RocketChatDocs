# Rocket.Chat Setup Wizard

After installing your Rocket.Chat server, it is time to configure and start enjoying all the fantastic features.

Rocket.Chat provides multiple [Rocket.Chat Client Apps](../../deploy/installing-client-apps/) that can be used for the user interface.

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide proceeds with the assumption you have either the latest Rocket.Chat Desktop client or Browser installed.

The server used for this guide is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), but if you are hosting your instance, it will is the link to your website with the port you specified in your settings.
{% endhint %}

### Adding Rocket.Chat server to Desktop Client

* After installing the [Rocket.Chat Desktop Client](../../deploy/installing-client-apps/#desktop-apps), launch the application.
* An interface is presented to you with a text field to input your server URL. Enter your server URL, in this case, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), for a local setup or specify the link to the domain of your server.
* Click **Connect.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that wherever the link [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) is used here, you have to specify your server's domain rather than [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
{% endhint %}

If you initially had any server linked on your client app, you can add another by clicking on the plus sign icon by the left of the navigation menu.

### Accessing Rocket.Chat Using Browser

To access Rocket.Chat in your browser, yo; you should type the link [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) or your server's domain in your browser.

## Setup Wizard

To launch your workspace, it is required to do a simple 4-step setup.

The necessary information includes your name, chosen username, your provided organizational email, and a password selected by you. The next thing to do is click on **Continue** to be taken to the page for the organization's information.
* **Organization Information**: This involves information about your organization. The data to be filled in about your organization include the organization's name, its type, the size of the organization, the country in which your organization operates, and the industry your organization is linked to, as well as your organization's website if there is any. When all the fields have been filled, you can click on **Continue** to proceed to the third step, which has to do with server information.
* **Server Info**: The server Info form has four fields which include the site name, selecting your preferred language from a dropdown, selecting whether the server is private or public, and finally selecting the option to opt into two-factor authentication via email. Click on the Continue option to go next step.
* **Register Your Server**: You are asked to register your workspace to the Rocket.Chat Cloud or proceed with a standalone server.
