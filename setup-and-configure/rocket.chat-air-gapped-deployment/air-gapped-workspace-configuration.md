# Air-gapped workspace Configuration

## Push Notification Configuration

To configure push notifications on your workspace, you can use the Rocket.Chat [push notification gateway](../../use-rocket.chat/rocket.chat-mobile/push-notifications/). You are required to complete your [offline-workspace-registration.md](offline-workspace-registration.md "mention").

{% hint style="info" %}
For fully air-gapped workspaces, you have to build a Rocket.Chat app for your desired mechanism. To learn more, see [Rocket.Chat App](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine).
{% endhint %}
