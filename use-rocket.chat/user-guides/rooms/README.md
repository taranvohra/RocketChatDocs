\*\*\*\*[**Discussions**](../../workspace-administration/settings/discussion.md): Allows a separate focused conversation around larger topics in a team or channel.

\*\*\*\*[**Direct Messages**](direct-messages/): Allows one-off conversations that do not require a channel or team.

## Mentions

When someone mentions you with `@username`, `@all` or `@here`, a symbol or a number will appear alongside the channel name. If someone mentions `@all` or `@here` a number will show up showing the number of times the mention is specific to you.
