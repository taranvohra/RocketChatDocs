# Teams

A **Team** can have multiple [channels](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels). In Rocket.Chat, **Team** is a digital workspace that allows you to manage multiple users simultaneously, making it easier for you to collaborate with teammates. For example, you have a team in your workspace for all core members that contains a list of channels you want them to belong to. If you add a new core member to that team, they have access to all the channels in that team. There will be no need to add them to those channels individually.

**Teams** are available to both community and enterprise clients. They are identified by: ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/team (2).png>)

\
**Teams** can be made private so that only invited members are allowed to join or public so that all Rocket.Chat users can see them. Each **Team** may consist of channels, which may also be either [public ](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels/types-of-channels#public-channels)or [private](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels/types-of-channels#private-channels).

## Team Privacy and Encryption

#### Read-Only Teams

Only authorized users (users with write permissions) can send messages in read-only teams. All other users can react to messages on this channel.

#### Broadcast Teams

Like read-only teams, broadcast teams allow only authorized users with the appropriate permissions to write new messages, while other users can reply to existing messages.

However, it differs from read-only teams in the following ways:

* All messages have a reply button that redirects you to the sender's direct message (DM), replying to the message as a quote.
* The team cannot be converted to a read-only again.

#### Encrypted Teams

Encrypted teams have end-to-end encryption enabled across all messages exchanged by the Team members.
