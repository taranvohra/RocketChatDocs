The Facebook Messager page allows you manage conversations from Facebook Messenger on the pages you have connected.

{% hint style="info" %}
This integration has known vulnerabilities and has been deprecated for Rocket.Chat 6.0. As a Rocket.Chat [Enterprise user](../../setup-and-configure/enterprise-edition-trial/) you can make use of the[ Facebook App](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/facebook-app/).
{% endhint %}

To access **Facebook Messenger m**anager's guide,

* Navigate to **Administration > Omnichannel > Facebook Messenger**.
* Select Facebook Messenger and Enable it. You'll be prompted to log in. Be sure to use the credentials that are tied to the page you wish to receive messages from. You'll have to do a standard Facebook OAuth login and grant your Rocket.Chat instance access to your pages.
* Once you're returned from Facebook, you'll see a list of the pages associated with that account. If you see none, ensure the account has pages, then click RELOAD PAGES.
* Enable the pages you'd like to get messages from.

Now, the **Live Chat** agents recieves any incoming chats from that page. Responses go back to Facebook as if you were using Messenger itself.
