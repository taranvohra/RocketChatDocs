# SAML

SAML(Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based format and protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.

This standard of authentication has significant advantages over logging in using a username/password:

* No need to type in credentials
* No need to remember and renew passwords
* No weak passwords

To access this setting, navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **SAML**
