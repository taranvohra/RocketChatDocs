## Custom Scripts

This takes in javascript code that will be executed on specified events.

* **Custom Script for Logout Flow**: Set a script to be run during any logout process.
* **Custom Script for Logged Out Users**: Custom Script that will run ALWAYS and to ANY user that is NOT logged in. e.g. (whenever you enter the login page).
* **Custom Script for Logged In Users**: Custom Script that will run ALWAYS and to ANY user that is logged in. e.g. (whenever you enter the chat and you are logged in)

### Example

Setting a custom script for logged-in users, like the example below, will alert "Welcome" whenever a user logs in and is on the `/home` page.

```
if(window.location.pathname == '/home'){
    alert("Welcome")
}
```
