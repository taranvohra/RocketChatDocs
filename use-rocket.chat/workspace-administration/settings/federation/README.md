# Federation

Federation allows for an unlimited number of workspaces to communicate with each other. Federating a workspace makes it visible to other workspaces over the federated network, thus making communication with other Federation-enabled servers possible.

To access Federation on your workspace, navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Federation**

Rocket.Chat provides Federation using the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/) and the [Rocket.Chat Federation Network](rocket.chat-federation) (Will be deprecated on 6.0.0).

Rocket.Chat provides federation in the following ways:

\*\*\*\*[**Matrix Bridge**](matrix-bridge/)**:** See how to federate your Rocket.Chat workspace with the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/).

\*\*\*\*[**Rocket.Chat Federation**](../../../rocket.chat-federation): Learn how to federate with Rocket.Chat basic federation.

{% hint style="info" %}
* We strongly recommend federating using Matrix Bridge.
* The Rocket.Chat basic federation is deprecated from version `6.0.`
